I'm Ngocanh.
a student.

Hello.
I'm a student at Vietnam–Korea University of Information and Communication Technology - VKU. I ❤️ try out new recipes and cook my own dishes. 

My Skills.
Design & Development
I started learning to code 3 year agos because I wanted to make my own websites. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing mobile and web applications.

Sweet Tooth Challenge
My real superpower? Conquering desserts. Who needs spicy when life is already this sweet?
